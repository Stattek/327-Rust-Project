// the main.rs file is where we have our main function
// In order to be able to run this program, this file MUST be named "main.rs"
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
}
// some commands to keep in mind:
// cargo run - runs the cargo program
// cargo check - checks that the entire program is okay and we can compile
